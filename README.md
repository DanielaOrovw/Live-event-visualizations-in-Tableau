# Live-event-visualizations-in-Tableau
Visualization is the process of representing data graphically and interacting with these representations in order to gain insight into the data. 

a.	Brand Mentions
This measure is unique in that it provides insight into how many times your brand is mentioned online, which includes sources like social media, 3rd party websites, and blogs. 

b.	Geographical distribution of fans
Social media is pivotal for digital communication; the daily and weekly posts helps the brand to monitor the traffic generated by its social media posts while comparing it to the increase in fans over time. It is also important to measure the activity of customers across various geographical locations. For live events occurring in various locations communicating with the customers in their indigenous languages and portraying the message across various channels is essential to effective communication.
